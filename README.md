<div class="PO">
  <h2>Project Overview</h2>
  <p>This project focuses on creating a machine learning model to help predict and classify different types of weather conditions, using a dataset with weather information from Sylhet. By analyzing patterns in data like temperature, humidity, pressure, and precipitation, the model aims to identify and classify weather conditions (e.g., sunny, rainy, or foggy).</p>
